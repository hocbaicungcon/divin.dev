#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int width, lngth, area, peri;
cout << "\n\n Find the Area and Perimeter
of a Rectangle :\n";
cout << "
---------------------\n";
cout<<" Input the length of the rect : ";
cin>>lngth;
cout<<" Input the width of the rect : ";
cin>>width;
area=(lngth*width);
peri=2*(lngth+width);
cout<<" The area of the rect is :
"<< area << endl;
cout<<" The perimeter of the rectangle
is : "<< peri << endl;
cout << endl;
return 0
}
